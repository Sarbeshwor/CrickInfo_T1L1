Additional Text from Article Page:
A bright smile flashed on Bengal pacer Akash Deep’s face when a member of the support staff flung a new ball towards him. He immediately measured his 
run-up and stood tossing the ball restlessly in his palms for his turn to come. And when it came, he bristled in and worked up a steady pace that once
 hustled Yashasvi Jaiswal and kept Rohit Sharma wary. He consistently hit the hard lengths and generated more bounce and pace than his Bengal teammate
 Mukesh Kumar, a dimension that would be factored in when choosing one among the two to partner Mohammed Siraj in the absence of the rested Jasprit Bu
mrah. If Wednesday’s nets session was an audition, Akash Deep would be the runaway winner.
But India would weigh other options too. Like playing a fou
rth spinner, should the pitch facilitate spin bowling early in the piece. In such an eventuality, Washington Sundar could get a look-in, after three y
ears in this format. Washington began with a few laps around the ground, before padding up and hitting the nets, where he batted as fluently as he had
 in his last Test outing, wherein he remained unbeaten on 96, striding out emphatically to defend and pressing back to launch his raspy cuts. His chie
f threat though would be Axar Patel, whose batting stocks have risen and bowling utility dipped.

A ripple of applause peeled the crisp forenoon ai
r when Ben Stokes suddenly made one ball leap off a good length and beat Jonny Bairstow. Encouraged, Stokes would amplify his aggression, crank up his
 pace by a few notches and keep Bairstow entirely shut, despite his efforts to unleash attacking strokes. He would beat him a few times and also hurry
 him into defensive prods on a couple of instances.
After every ball, a member of the medical staff would rush by Stokes’s side and ask if he felt any
 physical strain. In case he did, he did not show, as he regathered to bowl another ball. After a point, they stopped bothering and Stokes would bowl 
as intensely as he would in a Test match.

The England skipper regaining his bowling fitness would not have been better timed, with his side in dire need of a seam-bowling option
 if they are to continue their strategy of fielding three spinners. With the possibility of Ollie Robinson featuring in the game, giving a breather to
 James Anderson and Mark Wood, England would enjoy the fire and experience of Stokes, who last bowled against Australia at Lord’s last year. He was th
en operated on his left knee after the World Cup.
The final word, though, would be of the doctor and the physios, his colleague Ollie Pope would say: 
“We know what Stokes is like, he’s got that competitive edge. There’s every chance he’ll bowl, but he’s not confirmed it yet.”
xxx
Joe Root perished t
o his daring tool, the reverse scoop, in the last Test. The stroke incensed England’s former players, pundits and baffled spectators. He didn’t attemp
t that particular stroke in the nets again, but did summon the reverse variants, the sweep and the paddle sweep. Once he even shadow-practised a switc
h hit.
Later he essayed a vast array of orthodox cricketing strokes. The checked straight-drive stood out, as did his square-drives. So much so that i
t seemed not so much a case of him out-of-touch than finding outrageous ways to get out. Root was as calm and relaxed as he always is. With his arch-n
emesis Jasprit Bumrah too not around, Ranchi could be where he stands up to be counted and ends his drought.
Jonny Bairstow was gritting himself out f
rom an indifferent patch at the nets. He was literally the first man to hit the nets and the last to leave. He would devote the first half of his sess
ion to defensive shots, getting his alignment right, playing as straight as he could and resisting the loose flashes outside the off-stump. Streaky in
 the earlier exchanges, he would grow in confidence as the session dragged on, whereupon he would lash out his expansive strokes.




India versus England: Standing guard at Ranchi airport
 is father of first tribal cricketer with an IPL contr
act
February 21, 2024 20:52 IST
Robin Minz, with Dhoni as mentor, became a million-dol
lar-baby when Gujarat Titans shelled out Rs 3.60 crore
 for him; his father Francis Xavier Minz is a retired 
army man posted at the airport.

Additional Text from Article Page:
At the exit point of the arrival hall at the Birsa Munda International Airport in Ranchi stands Francis Xavier Minz, attentively watching every passen
ger filing in and out of the building. In a philosophical tone, he sums up the nature of the job: “I see everyone coming out of the airport, but hardl
y anyone notices me. Why should they? I’m just a security guy here, one of the many.”
Some hours ago, he had just watched the India cricketers stream 
past him after landing in their private jet. No one recognised him, even though he watched them in admiration, as they tugged their kit-bags along. Bu
t his heart swelled with joy and pride. For someday, he hopes, his son Robin would be one among them.
The 19-year-old batsman, the first tribal cricke
ter with an IPL contract, already has become one of the league’s million-dollar babies, after Gujarat Titans shelled out Rs 3.60 crore to acquire his 
signature in the auction a few months ago. But Francis knows how long and arduous the path to the Indian team is. “He has just started. The world has 
just about registered his name. Raasta abhi bhi lamba hain (the route to the Indian team is still a long way away),” he says.


A post shared by Gujar
at Titans (@gujarat_titans)
Just then a couple of youngsters pass through the entrance. He stops and asks them to show their IDs, which he inspects at
tentively. “This is my job, to ensure that no one who has left the airport re-enters without an ID. You never know who has a gun in his hand. One laps
e and I would lose my job,” he says. As an afterthought, he adds: “I cannot be lax because my son is an IPL cricketer. Of course, there is more financ
ial security in the family, but you never know how life would turn out to be. A lot of my colleagues ask me why I need to work anymore. But I tell the
m I will keep working as long as I feel like working and I am healthy,” he says.
Francis has been working and earning as long as he can remember. In h
is early teens, he performed odd jobs to sustain the family in his ancestral village, Telgaon in Gumla district, before he enrolled in the Army at the
 stroke of the century, just when the southern part of Bihar was carved into Jharkhand. “I don’t get sleep if I haven’t earned something for myself,” 
he says. Nearly two decades in the army — in the 9 Bihar Regiment, posted in Naxalite-hit areas of the state — has instilled in him a fierce sense of 
pride. “Whatever has changed, it’s only from the outside,” he adds.
The more life has changed on the outside, the more it has remained the same. “We s
till live in the same house. I still drive the same bike. It’s a decent house, so we have not even thought of moving or buying a bigger one. Fortunate
ly, Robin too has remained the same. He knows he has to keep working hard, and cannot be carried away. He is still the same old boy of ours,” he says.

Living his own dream
Somewhere deep inside, though, Francis is realising his own unfulfilled dream of becoming a sportsman. “Everyone knows the story
. I played hockey and football in my village, and sometimes competed in athletics too. The SAI centre in Delhi called me for a football camp, but I co
uldn’t join because I didn’t have a photo of me at that time. My village didn’t have a studio. Then I didn’t pursue further. There was no time for it,
” he says. The struggle to earn a livelihood was staring at his face.
His love for sports, though, remained undiminished. A certain long-haired swashb
uckler from Ranchi would fuel it further. Francis admits he is a Dhoni-tragic. “Ham sab hain (all of us are).” For a long time, Dhoni has known him. H
e used to give Robin cricket shoes and gear. A few days before the auction, the former India captain assured him that if no team picked him, Chennai S
uper Kings would.
Such a day though was unimaginable when Francis carved a bat out of wood for his son when he was a child. Seeing how good he was —“a
 natural hitter”— he brought him a tennis-ball cricket bat. “He always played cricket and then the idea struck me to put him in a coaching academy. An
d God bless, it worked,” he says.

Then he simply let him be, let his son find out how good or bad he was at the game. He was not a pushy father, who 
would watch every practice session of him or ask him how much he scored in a game. He offered just one piece of advice: “Whatever you do, do it with l
ove and heart, 100 percent commitment.” So far, his son has lived up to his father’s words. And one day, he hopes to see him pass through these same g
ates as an India cricketer. And one day, more people would recognise him as the father of Robin Minz.

India vs England: Why Ranchi pitch might not behave th
e way England think
February 21, 2024  20:08 IST
Ollie Pope calls the track crusty, platey but didn't t
he Australians said it was “prepared of soil from Mars
.”

Additional Text from Article Page:
Like a pair of inquisitive sleuths on a crime scene, Brendon McCullum and Jonny Bairstow squeezed through the ropes strung around the 22-yard strip an
d devoted the next 20 minutes deducing its nature. The duo bent, kneeled and craned their necks, probing the surface from every possible angle. Joe Ro
ot and Ollie Pope, too, joined them in their forensic examination, even as the two national curators and the local counterpart watched bemusedly from 
their pitch-side perch.
What intrigued the Englishmen, Pope would confess later, was the two-faced appearance of the surface. One half of the pitch, w
hen viewed vertically, is smattered with spots of dry grass; the other half is bald and brown, with “platey” cracks.“The top layer looked crusty. The 
cracks in the wicket aren’t just cracks, there are separate bits of ground that could open up with a lot of sun on them. The ball could deviate more o
ff them if they open up like we expect them to,” he would detail his assessment of the surface.
None of the decks in this series has been a rank turne
r. Typically, the pitch would be mostly true for the first two days, before it begins to deteriorate, offer turn, albeit slow, and invariable bounce. 
But Pope, and England fear that Ranchi would be the one India might look to twist the knife and serve up a spiteful turner.
One reason, Pope feels the
 hosts would seek the extreme, is the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, who terrorised the English batsmen more than the spinners did, and is the leading wic
ket-taker of the series. “With Japsrit missing the Test, they could go down the avenue (of dishing out a turner and unleashing four spinners),” he not
es.
He offers a more scientific reason too. “When we looked at the pitch, it was recently watered and moist. It was kept under the sun too. So it won’
t be a belter for sure,” he says. Selective watering and exposure to sunlight—the sun is more benign than harsh—could accelerate the cracking up proce
ss. The grass, more grey than green, is kept to bind the surface from not breaking up prematurely. “It depends on what India want, how they see it, if
 they want to leave a bit of grass on it, or shave it off. There is every chance they would do that (shave off the grass).”
Ranchi’s googly
It’s not t
he first time that the appearance of the Ranchi surface has spooked a traveling side. Back in 2017, the Australians fumed when they cast their eyes on
 the surface, which looked fearfully dark. But the supposed crack-laden pitch, “prepared of soil from Mars”, as an Australian daily put out, played ju
st fine and produced a thrilling draw. The surface held up, the turn was slow, and there was some assistance for fast bowlers in the first hour of Day
s 1 and 2.
The sinisterness of the pitch owed to the peculiar nature of the black soil here, which when watered assumes a deep, dark shade. Black soil
 is inherently slow in nature, unless it is over-exposed to sun. Batsmen get time to react to the amount of turn. Even when the ball keeps low, an ine
vitability when the pitch wears, it does not skid as waspishly as clayey red-soil surfaces would.
The Test against South Africa in 2019 produced a res
ult. The duration—it lasted three days and a session—could raise eyebrows. But it was not the surface that abetted the visitors’ capitulation, but the
ir own inept batting against India’s pacers Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav, who accounted for half of South Africa’s wickets.
Some turn, though, is in
evitable. Shubman Gills reminds: “This is India, you expect the ball to turn.” But when the ball begins to turn—and how much it does—is the abiding qu
estion. If it turns out to be a rank turner, Pope says, England would not be complaining. “If it does spin from ball one I guess it’s an even playing 
field. It doesn’t define the result, but it does give you an advantage if you win the toss and bat on the slightly flatter wickets,” he says.

Turners
, however, are a double-edge sword for India in the recent past. Earlier this year, India lost to Australia on a pitch that helped spinners.
Meanwhile
, India coach Rahul Dravid too moved anxiously around the wicket—perhaps the most ubiquitous image of the series—before he suddenly paused and stared 
meditatively on something that caught his attention. The curators would converge, listening to what the coach had to tell them and nodding their heads
. As soon the coach left, the curators instructed his groundsmen, scattered for lunch, to cover the pitch. They hastily obeyed the orders, wrapping th
e pitch that has intrigued the English cricketers, perhaps with another layer of potential mystery.

In order to hit the sixes, Krrishna pulled out the slog sweep to get a maximum off the first ball. Next, he smashed the second d
elivery clean over the bowler’s head and over the boundary. The third ball also met the same fate as it was cleanly dispatched over the midwicket boun
dary for another six.
The fourth ball was also slammed for a maximum in a nonchalant manner while the fifth was smoked over the over deep square leg b
oundary. In the last ball, Krishna played off his back foot and pulled it over mid-wicket.
However, in the Indian domestic circuit, this feat might re
mind fans of former India coach Ravi Shastri’s heroics in a Ranji Trophy match against Baroda in 1985. Shastri who had reached to his century in no ti

IND vs ENG: Ollie Pope’s cryptic Ranchi pitch assessme
nt: ‘One half is good, other half is…’
February 21, 2024  16:04 IST
India vs England: Ranchi has hosted two Tests out of w
hich India drew one against Australia in 2017 and thra
shed South Africa in 2019. The wicket tended to keep l
ow and slow in these games which is quite contrary to 
the pitch in Rajkot where the batters could score free
ly

Additional Text from Article Page:
Unlike the last series when England were greeted with ragging turners, this time, the wickets have been kinder to batters of both sides. They have bee
n neutral and have offered something to all departments. And now as the teams head to Ranchi with India leading the series 2-1 and pacer Jasprit Bumra
 rested, all eyes are once again on what kind of pitch will the curator offer.
“It’s an interesting pitch,” said Ollie Pope to reporters on Wednesday.
 “Won’t necessarily be belter of a wicket.”
“There are a few cracks, very platey and it was wet as well when we checked. It would dry if you keep it i
n the sun, looked a bit crusty, the top layer, One half is good, and the other has a lot of platey cracks,” he added.
“If it spins from ball one, it w
ould take the pitch out of the equation too. A lot of games start with a flat pitch, it would deteriorate. That kind of gives the team batting first s
ome advantage.” The England number three’s observation has been proven right so far in the series as the team winning the toss has won both matches th
us far in the series.
Ranchi has hosted two Tests out of which India drew one against Australia in 2017 and thrashed South Africa in 2019. The wicket 
tended to keep low and slow in these games which is quite contrary to the pitch in Rajkot where the batters could score freely during the third Test.

“At the moment, from the far end, there is a rough outside the right-hander’s off-stump, and from this end, outside the left-hander’s off-stump.” Bowl
ing into the rough helps the spinners get the natural variation from the pitch hence the tweakers tend to bowl around the area which tests batters’ te
chnique. “You need to be aware of the lengths they (Indian spinner) would target,” Pope cautioned.
Pope also predicted that in the absence of Bumrah, 
India might be tempted to give a turner and go with four spinners in their side. “If they want to leave a bit of grass on it, or shave it off. There i
s every chance they would do that (shave off the grass?) especially because they have watered it. With Jasprit missing, they might go down that avenue
. Probably have to wait and see.”




India vs England: How Michael Clarke slammed Bazballer
 Ben Duckett after his comment on Yashasvi Jaiswal
February 21, 2024  16:53 IST
IND vs ENG: Jaiswal scored a destructive 214 in which 
he hit 12 gigantic sixes

Additional Text from Article Page:
Bazballers were Bazballed on the third-day evening session when Yashasvi Jaiswal who was batting at a steady clip suddenly decided to flick the switch
 and go after the English bowling in Rajkot. In addition to the left-handers’ innings what grabbed the attention was England opener Ben Duckett’s “we 
said should take some credit” comments for Jaiswal’s knock after the play.
Former Australian cricketer Michael Clarke reacted to the comments. “Englan
d is not the first team to play aggressively or bat positively,” He said on  ESPN’s Around The Wicket. “Because you play a reverse sweep or a switch h
it or a ramp shot, that doesn’t mean you are batting aggressively either,” the former skipper would add.
Jaiswal scored a destructive 214 in which he 
hit 12 gigantic sixes. “When you see players from the opposition playing like that, it almost feels like we [England] should take some credit that the
y’re playing differently than how other people play Test cricket,” Duckett would say after Day three.
“We saw it a bit in the summer and it’s quite ex
citing to see other players and other teams are also playing that aggressive style of cricket.” he further added.
Clarke also mentioned that the moder
n teams have not been showing particularly any additional aggression which was not shown in the past but because of T20 cricket, the shot selection ha
s changed. “Because of T20 cricket, we are seeing different shots, we are seeing players play the full 360 in all three formats. You didn’t see that a
s much in Test cricket,” he said.
Clarke would also take the reference of former Australian legends and would recall the positive approach they took a
gainst the bowlers. “As a youngster, he must not know what Test cricket Australia played. Has he heard of Matthew Hayden, Michael Slater, Ricky Pontin
g, Damien Martyn, Adam Gilchrist? These guys used to smack it as good as everyone” Clarke slammed Duckett.




Fast bowler Akash Deep likely to make Test debut at Ra

Bengal fast bowler Akash Deep, 27, is likely to make his Test debut during fourth Test against England in Ranchi which starts on Friday. Akash is set 
to play in place of Jasprit Bumrah, who has been released for the game to manage his workload.
Akash and Mukesh Kumar, also a Bengal fast bowler, are 
the two pace options to partner Mohammed Siraj for the fourth Test. But The Indian Express understands that the team management and selectors are like
ly to go with Akash as they are impressed with the way he bowled in the matches between India A and England Lions  Akash picked up 10 wickets from two
 red-ball games for India A in Ahmedabad. Together with Mukesh, Akash has been a leading fast bowler for Bengal in red-ball cricket. Akash has scalped
 104 wickets from 30 First-Class games, averaging 23.58.
Mukesh bowled 12 overs during the second Test in Vizag but wasn’t a wicket-taking threat on a
 flat track. His only wicket was that of No.10 Shoaib Bashir in the second innings.
In a press release, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCC
I) secretary Jay Shah said that Bumrah had been released for the fourth Test. “The decision was taken keeping in mind the duration of the series and t
he amount of cricket he has played in recent times,” Shah stated in the release.

Milne sprays one across the line and Head slaps it over 
cover for FOUR. WICKET! Miscue and Southee takes a superb catch running besides from mid-on. Massive wicket for the Kiwis. Mitch Marsh suffers a loud 
shout first up as Milne shapes one in. The umpire is unmoved but Santner reviews. Replays suggest the ball is sliding down leg.
Travis Head c Southee 
b Milne 24 (15b 3x4 1x6)
A tepid start for Australia. Lockie Ferguson comes into the attack against David Warner and Travis Head. A quick bumper and W
arner dabs it to square-leg for a single. Short again but Head muscles it over deep mid-wicket for a SIX this time.
Two fifties of contrasting styles 
from Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway have set up Australia a 216-run target. In case if you have just tuned in, here's everything you need to know ab
out this high-octane series.

Captain Mitch Marsh into the attack. Tight lines from Marsh. Short-ball

Allen is in 
the zone. Hazlewood slides one in on the full and Allen clears his front-leg and steers the ball down the ground for FOUR. A couple of singles to foll

NZ!
Glenn Maxwell replaces Starc. Conway drives the ball through cover for a single. Fraction short and Allen rocks back to slap the ball down the gro

Josh Hazlewood from the opposite end. Hazlewood finds the leading edge off Conway's blade but it
 skims past backward point. Starc makes ground in the deep but the batters reel in three runs. BANG! Allen makes some room and charges to pump Hazlewo
od over deep mid-wicket for a massive SIX. Hazlewood overpitches and Allen uses the width to loft the ball over cover for FOUR. Hazlewood tails one in
 and Allen taps it back. Allen gives another charge but misses it altogether as Hazlewood slides it past leg-stump.
Starc to Allen with a slip in plac
e. Quick delivery on length first-up. The cross-seamer zips past Allen's outside-edge to the keeper. A touch of swing this time as Starc slides the ba

 at mid-wicket and Allen is off the blocks with a hack for a single. Gentle shape and Conway dabs the ball behind point for one run. Sharp bouncer fro
m Starc as Allen throws his bat for a pull and misses.Trouble for Allen. A late inswinging yorker rushes in and Allen digs it out towards short mid-wi
cket and sets off on a risky single. Short fails to latch on to the ball as Conway sends his partner back.
It's going to be a high-octane clash, no do
ubt. Mitch Starc is up with the new ball against Finn Allen and Devon Conway. Starc and Cummins are playing their first T20I since the 2022 T20 World 
Cup!
Looks like a fine day for cricket in Wellington. Finn Allen and Devon Conway set to open for the Kiwis. But before that the teams will receive a 
cultural Maori welcome. The teams lineup for the national anthems.

David Warner needs 54 runs to become th

Glenn Maxwell will surpass Aaron Finch (103) for the most appearance

Lockie Ferguson (49) needs one wicket to become the second-fastest Kiwi bowler to reach 50 T20I wickets.
Skipper Mitch
 Marsh has suggested that Steve Smith might not make the Playing XI.
“There will be certain guys that probably bat in different positions than they ha
ve done in the past, but ultimately we’re here to win the series. I’ve batted three for the last 18 months, so I’ll be there to start with. And obviou
sly Heady and Davey Warner have been amazing for us over the last period of time, so I daresay that will be the top three,” Mitchell Marsh told cricke

“Over here, it’s always the harsh reality that we’re neighbours, in sport we like to beat each other,” Warner said in Wellington on Monday.

“From that perspective, we’re going to be expecting the crowd to come at us as hard as they come. As we always say, it’s in one ear, out the other – i
f I actually hear anything.”
“I enjoy playing here. It’s about coming out and trying to put my best foot forward, and score runs.
“The crowd, yeah, th
ey got personal, but if they have to get personal, that’s their character ... if you want to pay your money to come and abuse people, you have to go b
ack and lay in your own bed.
“We’re here to play the game of cricket that we love, enjoy and put bums on seats to keep the game going," Warner said.

Jasprit Bumrah released from India’s squad for the fou

February 21, 2024  19:38 IST
"The decision was taken keeping in mind the duration o
f the series and amount of cricket he has played in re
cent times," read a statement from the BCCI.

Additional Text from Article Page:
India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been released from the squad for the upcoming fourth Test against England in Ranchi later this week.
“Jaspri
t Bumrah has been released from the squad for the 4th IDFC First Bank Test against England in Ranchi. The decision was taken keeping in mind the durat
ion of the series and amount of cricket he has played in recent times,” read a statement from the BCCI on Tuesday.
The Indian Express, as reported ear
lier, understands that while Bumrah was keen on playing all five Tests, with the IPL, T20 World Cup and other marquee assignments coming up, the team 
management and selectors advised him to sit out the Ranchi Test as he would be needed in the final game in Dharamsala, where the conditions are more c
onducive for seamers.
Among other updates: KL Rahul, who picked up an injury in Hyderabad earlier in the series and missed out the Visakhapatnam and R
ajkot Tests, has also been ruled for the match in Ranchi.
Mukesh Kumar, who made his Test debut for India last year and was dropped from the squad for
 the Rajkot Test has been recalled.
Having lost the first match, India completed a comeback in the five-Test series with a 434-run shellacking in Rajk
ot to follow a 104 run win in Vizag.
India’s squad for the 4th Test: Rohit Sharma (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Rajat Patidar, Sarfaraz Khan, D
hruv Jurel (WK), KS Bharat (WK), Devdutt Padikkal, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd. Siraj, Mukesh Kumar,

Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma blessed with baby boy ‘
Akaay’, share news on social media

The child who is named Akaay was born on February 15,

Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma on Tuesday announced that they have become parents to a baby boy. The child who is named Akaay was born on February 15,
 the couple announced on their respective Instagram handles.
“With abundant happiness and our hearts full of love, we are pleased to inform everyone t
hat on February 15th, we welcomed our baby boy Akaay and Vamika’s little brother into this world,” both Kohli and Anushka wrote.
Earlier this month, K
ohli’s long-time Roya Challengers Bangalore teammate AB de Villiers had shared on his YouTube channel that the couple was expecting their second child
. De Villers shared excerpts from the texts which he and Kohli had exchanged.


A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli)
“So I wrote to him ‘Been w
anting to check in with you (sic) for a while now biscuits. How are you?’. He said ‘Just need to be with my family right now. I am doing well.’. Yes, 
his second child is on the way.”
But later, in an interview with Dainik Bhaskar, de Villiers would conceded, “I made a terrible mistake at the same ti
me, sharing false information, which was not true at all. I think whatever’s best for Virat’s family comes first. No one knows what’s happening there,
 all I can do is wish him well.”
Last month, as India announced their squad for the first two of five Tests against England, the BCCI had stated in a 
press release that Kohli will miss the matches in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam ‘citing personal reasons’.
With anticipation around his comeback later i
n the series, the Indian cricket board stated ahead of the Rajkot Test that the former India captain had pulled out of the remainder of the series.
“V
irat Kohli will remain unavailable for selection for the remainder of the series due to personal reasons. The Board fully respects and supports Mr. Ko
hli’s decision,” the BCCI stated.

India’s talismanic wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant on Tuesday, shared another positive update on his social media with regards to his recovery follo
wing his car accident in late 2022.
Taking to his X account, Pant shared a video of himself padded up and keeping stumps, captioned ‘Progressing’. Thi

It’s been more than a year since Rishabh Pant last donned the Indian colors. Having played a maj
or role in India’s Test series win against Bangladesh, Pant’s career was put to a halt following his car accident late in 2022. An accident which left
 him with a torn ligament in his right knee and two cuts to his forehead.
Following his surgery in Mumbai, Pant has been undergoing rehab at the Natio
nal Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore and optimistic of his comeback soon to professional cricket.
“Till the time I start playing cricket, I don’t wa
nt to plan much for the future. I asked the doctor how long will it take for me to recover. I told him that everybody is speaking different things, bu
t you will give me the most clarity about it,” he said.
“He (Doctor) said it would take 16 to 18 months. I told the doctor from whatever timeline you 
give me, I will reduce six months from it,” added Pant, who didn’t count out on the possibility of playing IPL for Delhi Capitals in the upcoming seas
on starting March.
Pant had attended the Capitals camp in November last year and was also among those present at the franchise’s IPL auction table at 
Dubai in December.
Recently, the DC head coach Ricky Ponting had conceded that while Pant has been “very confident” of featuring in the entirety of th
e upcoming IPL season, he doubts that the 26-year-old would be completely fit for the same.




India vs England: No Jasprit Bumrah for Ranchi Test, w
ill India go for a turner?
February 21, 2024  09:34 IST
Playing an extra spinner strengthens batting while Muk
esh was ineffective in Vizag.

Additional Text from Article Page:
As Team India landed in Ranchi, a familiar face that has been tormenting England was missing. As previously reported by The Indian Express, the hosts 
will take the field in the fourth Test without star pacer Jasprit Bumrah, with the selectors and team management giving him a break to manage his work
load. With Bumrah out of the Test, India’s think-tank is in a huddle about his replacement in the XI.
During the previous selection committee meeting,
 the selectors had informed the team management about the need to rest Bumrah keeping the road ahead in mind. Although the pacer is understood to have
 been keen on playing all five Tests, The Indian Express understands that with the IPL, T20 World Cup and other marquee assignments coming up, the tea
m management and selectors advised him to sit out the Ranchi Test as he would be needed in the final game in Dharamsala.
In the three Tests so far, mo
re than the spinners, it is Bumrah who has had England in all sorts of trouble with his lethal reverse-swing. Though the workload management system ha
sn’t raised any red flags as yet, given his history of back issues, it was inevitable that India would have to play a Test without him. And now that I
ndia are entering the territory, the big question is who comes in place of Bumrah.

Much of it would now depend on the c
onditions that India encounter in Ranchi. Having chosen to play on traditional slow pitches that tend to start flat and deteriorate as the Test progre
sses, for the first time in this series India are contemplating whether to go for a turner. If that is the case, India could bring in Washington Sunda
r or Axar Patel in place of Bumrah to strengthen the batting. Ranchi, like the other venues in the series, has black soil pitches. And it is understoo
d that so far, pitch preparation has gone the same way as it did in Hyderabad, Vizag and Rajkot. However, should India prefer a turner, the groundstaf
f only has to do selective watering or stop it altogether.
For Ranchi, India have Mukesh Kumar and uncapped Akash Deep to choose from as Mohammed Sira
j’s partner. But in the lone Test he played in the series at Vizag, on a flat deck, Mukesh struggled to pose any sort of threat to the Bazballers. And
 having taken a 2-1 lead, India are wary of not losing the momentum, particularly because at Dharamsala – the venue for the fifth Test – England would
 feel at home because of the conditions on offer.
Akash Deep had a good outing against England Lions. But exposing a newcomer to Bazball could come wi
th its own risks, which is why playing an extra spinner is being considered as an option.

Even at Vizag, where Siraj was rested, India had initially 
planned to play Washington, but eventually went with Mukesh, who bowled only 12 overs in the match.
Even if it isn’t a turner, India believe playing a
nother spinner would strengthen the team as both Washington and Axar are bankable options with the bat. The reason India are sceptical about playing o
n a rank turner is their inexperienced batting unit. A clear picture is expected when head coach Rahul Dravid makes his first dash to the pitch on Wed
nesday afternoon.




Sarfaraz now has to score in foreign countries, Jaiswa
l ready for all formats: Ganguly
February 21, 2024  08:35 IST
Sarfaraz sizzled against the English bowlers, scoring 
fifties in both innings to become only the fourth Indi
an to achieve the feat on Test debut.

Additional Text from Article Page:
Former India captain Sourav Ganguly was the latest to sing debutant Sarfaraz Khan’s praises after the youngster’s fine performance against England in 
the 3rd Test at Rajkot.
“Sarfaraz has started well. He now has to score in foreign countries. He is a good example for budding cricketers, who must ke
ep in mind that if they score consistently, they will get their chances,” Ganguly said to Mid Day.
The 26-year-old Sarfaraz had endured a long wait to
 make his debut in national colours, despite setting the domestic circuit on fire with consistent runs in the red-ball format since 2019. The Mumbai b
atter sizzled against the English bowlers, scoring fifties in both innings to become only the fourth Indian to achieve the feat on Test debut.
Even In
dian captain Rohit Sharma had lauded Sarfaraz’s presence during his first international match. “I have not seen Sarfaraz bat that much. But I have hea
rd from Bombay (Mumbai) players that he has scored runs in difficult situations. And big runs,” he had said after the match.
“It gives an idea about h
is personality. Very hungry for runs and he has been scoring consistently. We didn’t discuss plans – we knew khula chod do toh kaam kar lega (job woul
d be done if he was set open freely). That’s what I had heard from Bombay players also. He did seem nervous on the morning of the Test, but once the g
ame started, he brought energy into the match. Felt good to see him score,” Rohit had added.

Meanwhile, Ganguly also praised the efforts of Yashasvi 
Jaiswal who notched up his second double century in as many games.
“Jaiswal is not only a good player, he’s capable of playing all in formats of the g
ame,” Ganguly said.
In the match, After setting a 557-run target, courtesy of Jaiswal’s second-innings double hundred (214 not out), India pulled off 
their biggest Test win (by runs) as England folded for 122. Jadeja, who scored a vital hundred earlier in the game, revelled with the ball on his home
 ground with figures of five for 21.




Former India player Manoj Tiwary on Ranji Trophy: ‘On 
domestic cricket circuit some umpires nurse hangover …
 ‘prefer whisky on the rocks, they say’
February 21, 2024  09:38 IST
Cramped dressing rooms in Thumba, Kerala, made it impo
ssible to strategise as the opposition team could hear
 conversations

Additional Text from Article Page:
MANOJ Tiwary, a pillar of Bengal cricket and with over 10,000 First-class runs under his belt, retired last week after a two-decade long career. A wee
k before he hung up his boots, Tiwary posted on X that there were ‘so many things wrong’ in Ranji Trophy cricket, the country’s premier domestic tourn
ament. “It is losing its charm and importance. Absolutely frustrated.” Tiwary, a Trinamool Congress politician and the Bengal sports minister, spoke t
o The Indian Express about why he ranted; from hungover umpires to cramped dressing rooms, to IPL-contracted players not ready to grind it out in dome
stic red-ball cricket, the reasons are many he says. Excerpts.
You had recently posted on X that Ranji Trophy should be ‘scrapped off from the calenda
r’ Why?
I gave this assessment based on what I witnessed while playing in the tournament. The significance and charm of Ranji Trophy has diminished be
cause the IPL auction happens before the tournament starts. Once a player gets an IPL contract, they don’t have the drive to play Ranji Trophy. There 
is also the fear that if an injury is sustained during a Ranji Trophy game, it could affect the IPL contract. There is a lot of money involved in the 
IPL. I think domestic cricket needs ‘servicing’ now.
Do you think those with IPL contracts don’t take Ranji Trophy seriously enough?
Yes, players don’
t play with seriousness after that (getting an IPL contract). When we started playing domestic cricket, we were told to play with seriousness, be dete
rmined, play for the team and aim to be a match-winner. I don’t see that grit and hunger in domestic cricket anymore. Players picked for IPL, they com
e and play only one way. I’m not saying it’s bad but it’s similar style. Ranji Trophy is the tournament, which can produce cricketers who are ready fo
r Test cricket. IPL can teach a player about ‘intent’ but carelessness also creeps in as players are trying to score off everyball. In Ranji Trophy yo
u have to grind out your runs.
Ranji trophy should be scrapped off from the calendar from the next season onwards. So many things going wrong in the t
ournament. So many things need to looked into in order to save this prestigious tournament which has a rich history. It’s losing its charm and importa
nce.…
— MANOJ TIWARY (@tiwarymanoj) February 10, 2024
You also spoke about scheduling issues. Could you elaborate?
India A matches should not be sched
uled at the same time as Ranji Trophy games. A lot of time and effort goes into preparing a team for a Ranji Trophy season. And then three to four pla
yers from that team are called up for India A duty. In our team (Bengal), the top two players were representing India A and one was on India duty. I’m
 fine with Mukesh Kumar on India duty but Akash Deep and Abhimanyu Easwaran were playing for India A. They are core members of the team and in the pas
t their performance helped us to reach the final. When these players left, our team became weak.
What about matches held in peak winter in North India
?
In North Zone and East Zone there is fog and playing matches at that time has resulted in draws and teams having to split points. In the end, it aff
ects a team’s position on the points table. An example was our game against Uttar Pradesh. There was no play for two days because of bad weather. Same
 thing happened during the game against Chhattisgarh. We wanted to qualify for the knockouts but because of the weather, we lost out on points. These 
issues need to be considered when preparing the schedule.
What about the facilities at venues? Have you faced any issues?
Yes in Kerala, we played not
 at the stadium but at Xavier’s college ground (in Thumba). The college dressing rooms were very small and close to each other. There was no privacy f
or both the teams. If we spoke or planned anything, the opposition team could hear us. So we had to formulate plans on the ground. Ranji Trophy games 
should be played at venues where there are basic facilities.
You had said on X that you were frustrated with the state of Ranji Trophy cricket. What a
re your other concerns?
Umpiring for me is the main concern. With all due respect, but the standard of umpiring is poor in domestic cricket. The BCCI 
should think about how they can improve umpiring. It is not about one or two seasons but I have been witnessing this for a number of years now. There 
are big mistakes but there are some childish mistakes as well.
Can you elaborate?
In one game, an off-spinner was making a particular noise after each
 delivery. Many bowlers do… it’s like they are putting some energy on the ball and it sounds like ‘uhhhhhhhh’. In this case an off-spinner was screami
ng ‘noooo’. At first I ignored it but later I saw the bowler was doing it consistently. I went to the umpire and complained but the umpire said he did
 not hear the bowler saying ‘noooo’.
In the same game, the umpire was referring no-ball decisions to the third umpire after each delivery. I asked, “S
ir, why are you referring no ball calls to the umpire. He replied, ‘how can I see the popping crease of the bowler? If I watch where the bowler’s foot
 lands then, I will not be able to see what happens to the ball’.” At times umpires can’t hear a batsman nicking the ball, but everyone at the ground 
has heard it.

Do you plan to make recommendations to the BCCI?
I will definitely do it. If a player has to go through dope tests, it should be extend
ed to domestic umpires. Many times I have seen umpires walking out to the middle while still nursing a hangover. The umpires have looked sleepy. How c
an he function properly in such a situation?.
I asked, “Sir kya liye tha kal raat mein? (Sir, what did you drink last night?). The reply was: “I prefe
r whisky on the rocks.” And they laugh. BCCI should get the hearing and eyesight of every umpire checked before the start of each season.
Are you fine
 with the concussion rule in domestic cricket?
It should be relooked at. This rule is being misused by players with IPL contracts. There have been ins
tances where a batsman is hit on the helmet… ‘halka sa ekdum’. Then you see that the batsman is walking back. Earlier, when a batsmen would get hit, n
o one dared to go and sit back in the dressing room. Unless of course there was a serious issue. It should be looked into.
This will be a lifetime mem
ory for me. Thank you my family #TeamBengal for the incredible gesture. I really wanna thank Head Coach @Lshukla6, all the magnificent support staff a
nd my outstanding colleagues. 🏏

layers shouldn’t be blamed. If a young player is getting Rs 5 crores from the IPL, it goes to their head. He will tell himself that ‘I will play two m
onths of IPL cricket and earn so much money’. Why would a player toil hard in red-ball cricket for a small amount of money when he can earn in million
s by playing two months in the IPL. It (referring to Ishan Kishan) is the first time I have seen a player informing an Indian team during a series tha
t he has mental fatigue and takes a break and then is reportedly seen partying. An IPL player has so much financial security. He knows that someone at
 the top will help in the future and everything will be fine.
Are you happy with the pitches being prepared for domestic cricket?
For me this neutral 
curator concept should be done away with. It’s a sham. A neutral curator takes over the preparation of the pitch some 5-6 days before each game. They 
have to ensure that the home team does not get an advantage. But in one game, the ball began to turn from the first few overs itself. The game lasted 
just four sessions.
Hi all,
So… It’s time for the one last dance! Possibly one last time for a long walk towards my beloved 22 yards. I will miss ever
y bit of it! 🏏
Thanks for cheering and loving me all these years. Would be loving it if you all come down to my favourite #EdenGardens today and… pic.

You retired after 20 years of playing the game, Any regrets?
I enjoyed my time.
 I have scored more than 10,000 first class runs but till date I feel sad that I wasn’t able to play Test cricket for India. One day I would like to a
sk Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni) why I was dropped from the playing XI in 2011 after scoring a century (versus West Indies in an ODI)? I had the potential to b
e a hero just like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli. Today, when I see many people getting more opportunities, I feel sad. Overall it has been a great ride f
or me and cricket has given me everything and changed my life. So no complaints.
