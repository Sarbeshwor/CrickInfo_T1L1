Watch: Joe Root’s special message to Jonny Bairstow on his 100th 
Test match
March 8, 2024 09:22 IST
Joe Root knows Jonny Bairstow since the two were 12 year old
. It was fitting that Bairstow received his 100th Test cap f
rom his childhood friend with tears in everyone’s eyes on Da
y 1 of the fifth Test match at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket 
Association (HPCA) Stadium in Dharamsala.
On Thursday, Jonny
 Bairstow will become the 17th player to reach 100 Tests for
 England.
“We find ourselves stood here at the foot of the H
imalayas. You’ve already climbed a mountain to get here. 12 
years old when I first met you, coming through the Yorkshire
 academy. And the talent you had then was evident for everyo
ne to see,” says Root.
“That being said to get to a hundred 
Test matches, it’s not a straight road. You are goona come o
ver some roadblocks along the way. And your best strengths a
s a character and as a player is to be able to face challeng
es and adversity. Show huge amount of tenacity,” says Root w
ith everyone in the huddle burst into a laughter.
Not a dry 
eye in the huddle 🥲

redible cap presentations come 🧢 🦁 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿

Despite having such a long caree
r, Bairstow has never had a settled role in England’s Test s
ide. His batting position has changed over the years and whe
ther he would keep wicket has also never been certain. Root 
also touched upon the journey of Bairstow.
“I know how much 
you care to play for England and how much this cap, this bad
ge, this shirt means to you.
“It’s another big part of who y
ou are as a player. Within your hundred games, you’ve broken
 and set many different records with both gloves and with th
e bat.
“You’ve played some of the most exciting and exhilara
ting innings in a Test shirt, and even at the forefront of s
ome of England’s greatest ever Test wins.”
It’s well documen
ted that Jonny’s father David, a Test cricketer himself, too
k his life because of depression in 1998.
“We all know how p
roud Janet your mum, Becky, the rest of your family back hom
e, and of course Meg and Edward who in time will learn all t
he amazing feats you’ve achieved. Also know that your dad is
 shining down on you, beaming with pride and a huge smile on
 his face, today and this week,” says Root.
“We all look for
ward to making many more memories with you, on and off the f
ield. Enjoying one of those special barbecues round at your 
house at some point.
“Promise me one thing this week, you’ll
 try and relax. You try and enjoy it and you’ll be genuine a
nd authentic to who you are as a player. Stick your chest ou
t. Look him in the eye alright but stay in your crease alrig
ht.”
Bairstow scored a quickfire 18-ball 29 before he was di
smissed by Kuldeep Yadav.
